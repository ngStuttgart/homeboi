This project was created as part of the [#wirvsvirus hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/)

## Inspiration
From nearly one day to another, the corona-crisis brought a lot of office-worker into the situation that they had to work from their home-office where they don't find a professional equipment. 

Professional equipment is essential because it enables them to work efficiently and ergonomically. On the other hand a lot of companies offices are orphaned and mostly very well equipped. But how can we bring these two parties together?

## What it does
Our solution 'HomeBoi' acts as a marketplace where home-office workers can fastly find professional equipment and companies on the other side are able to make a little bit of money from their unused equipment.
